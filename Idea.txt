Functionality:
- All pages are server rendered
- Navigation within website doesn't require full reload
- Works with javascript disabled (if possible to make)
- Blog posts are written in markdown (maybe custom flavor ?)


Technical considerations:
- Need lightweight front end framework for handling navigation and page updating without reloading (
    type-script?babel? transpile for old browser, don't transpile for new ones
)
- Need a nodejs framework for generating static web-pages from markdowns 


/src/core/client - client framework logic;
/src/core/generator - parses *.md files into *.json and *.html


Blog building blocks:
1. Blog content itself:
    1.1 Text: Headings, paragraphs, quotes, some focused quote from the text itself.
    1.2 Code: Just the code, runnable code examples.
    1.3 Images, their formatting around text.
2. Url - slug;
3. Metadata:
    3.1 Tags: Popular tags, tags next to blog post listing, tags when reading blog.
    3.2 Author.
    3.3 Title.
    3.4 Date.
    3.5 etc.. (hero image);
4. Blogs navigation:
    4.1 Search?;
    4.2 Associated blogs by tag;
    4.3 Next, previous, recommended at the end to the blog;
5. Comments;
6. Social buttons;
7. Maybe some catchy internal like button;
