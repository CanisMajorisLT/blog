I spent 3 days this week exploring Amsterdam and attending first ever [performance.now](https://perfnow.nl/) conference. I can honestly say that both - the city and the conference pleasantly surprised me.

I knew that lots of people consider Amsterdam to be one of the best cities to visit (also to live in). However looking at pictures and videos of the city I never saw what so special about it. But now I can confirm what people say is true - it's very cool, cozy, and livid city, with beautiful architecture and great vibe. My favorite city I have visited to date!

The conference itself was even bigger surprise. While it was an intense one -  2 day, single track and with 16 speakers (50 minutes each). Everything was very well organized, each talk started and finished exactly on time. Transitions between speakers were the smoothest I have seen, hosts were very professional and with great sense of humor. All of the speakers were very well prepared with topics that covered basically everything there is to know about front end performance - from js, css, images and fonts to HTTP headers and protocols to creating performance oriented culture at companies. Every single talk was relevant and interesting.

Before conference I felt like I knew a lot about optimizing apps for performance, but now I realize that it's way bigger and deeper topic than I realized. It doesn't help that best practices keep changing all the time. But [performance.now](https://perfnow.nl/) did a great job to give a good picture of what works today and what's in a future pipeline for protocols and browsers.
_________

Overall 10/10 would recommend this conference and as added benefit you'll get to visit Amsterdam.
