This is the first blog post in this blog.

I grew up in Amsterdam, which is a pretty rough town by Dutch Standards. As a kid there are all kinds of temptations and peer-pressure to join in in bad stuff is something that is hard to escape. But somehow that never was a big factor for me, computers and electronics kept me fascinated for long enough that none of that ever mattered. But being good with computers is something that sooner or later also is something that you realize can be used for bad.

For me that moment came when one of my family members showed up at my combined house-office in the summer of 1997. The car he drove was a late model E-Class Mercedes. This particular family member has a pretty checkered history. When I still lived with my mom as a kid he would show up once or twice every year, unannounced and would comment on our poor condition and would give me a large bill to go to the night store and get luxury food. Salmon, French cheese, party time. Always flashing his success and mostly pretending to be wealthy. He vowed he’d pay for my driving license which is a big deal here in NL, that costs lots of money, but then never did. This was fine by me, I could easily pay for it myself but it didn’t exactly set the stage for a relationship of trust. Also, in the years prior to this I had never seen or heard from him.

What had changed was this: a few weeks prior to the visit there had been a large newspaper article about me and one of the things that it mentioned was my skills with computers. And this must have been the reason that my family member decided that those skills were undervalued by the marketplace and I needed a bit more in terms of opportunities.

Get a stack of notecards.  On each notecard, write a title for a feature you worked on or a project you managed. Under the title you want a one sentence description of your main objective. Under that you want to list the most important tools that enabled the solution. Think of this as tags you’d put under a question on Stack Overflow. Under this, write down as many things you can think of that you tried and that failed; you can limit the list to 5 but don’t stop before you reach that number unless you actually tried fewer things (and that’s okay).  Underneath that, write down the thing that ended up working.

Now flip the card over. On the top, write down the single most valuable thing you learned from this project in a single phrase. You should list only the most critical insight to finding the solution to the problem. If you haven’t solved this problem yet, it should be the most recent insight you’ve had from it. Underneath this, write down one line about where this idea came from. Underneath that, repeat this process until the card is full.

I often hear people tell me they don’t know which features and projects their interviewers are going to want to hear about. They are going to want to hear about something in the materials that you gave them.  If you give them a resume, expect questions about stuff you worked on at your past jobs. If you gave them a link to your Github profile, expect questions about your projects.  If you gave them a link to your Stack Overflow account, expect questions about some of your answers. Make sure you have at least one card for each job experience you have listed, and ideally one for each bullet point you have listed for each job experience. Make sure you have one for each Github project that you have worked on in the last year. For Stack Overflow questions, just make sure you’re familiar with your most popular questions and answers (no need to write whole cards for them). That about covers everything you might be asked about.

Here’s an example card for a project from my Developer Story.
